JEET.Lab3 - Country Information Web App (REST API & JSP)
This project was developed based on the "Lab.3: Building efficient web applications using: JSP, JSTL, REST API and Maven" student guide prepared by Łukasz Laszko. The application serves as a web-based client that fetches and displays real-time data from a public RESTful web service.

🎓 Academic Scope
This laboratory work focuses on creating efficient web interfaces and integrating external data sources:

JSP & JSTL: Utilizing JavaServer Pages and JSTL tags for dynamic content rendering and logic separation.

REST API Integration: Implementing a web service client to retrieve global country information.

Data Presentation: Building advanced HTML tables to display complex datasets (flags, maps, capitals, etc.).

Error Handling: Implementing robust error management for web requests and API responses.

🛠 Technical Architecture
Frontend: JSP (JavaServer Pages) enhanced with JSTL (JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library) for clean loop and conditional operations.

Backend: Java-based REST client integrated within a Maven web application structure.

External Service: Integration with a public REST API to fetch country details such as flags, currencies, and maps.

Build Tool: Maven for managing project dependencies and web deployment.

🚀 Features & Usage
Search Functionality: Users can search for countries by name or fragments of names using regular expressions.

Detailed Data View: The application displays at least 8 columns of data including:

Common and Official Names

Capital Cities

Top-Level Domains (TLD)

Interactive Maps (OpenStreetMaps)

Visual Assets (Flags and Coats of Arms).

Responsive Tables: Data is organized in a clean, row-numbered table for easy navigation.
